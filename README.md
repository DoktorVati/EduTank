During the creation of this educational tank game, I wrote a 19 page conference ready research paper. 
Here is the Research Abstract: 

# Abstract
A student's motivation to learn is significantly influenced by the degree of engagement and enjoyment provided by assignments. While digital learning tools, such as quiz based platforms, have been widely used to enhance student learning, they often struggle to maintain long term engagement. Repetitive tasks and a lack of enjoyment can lead to a decline in student motivation over time. This project addresses these challenges by integrating educational content within a game environment, thereby promoting both effective learning and sustained student engagement. The educational tank game developed for this study combines an intuitive combat system with the familiar multiple choice quiz format, offering both an interactive and immersive learning experience. Players are rewarded for correct answers and penalized for incorrect ones, reinforcing knowledge retention while ensuring entertainment value and enhancing replayability. This paper explores the design, implementation, and effectiveness of this educational game in improving student motivation and learning outcomes.
